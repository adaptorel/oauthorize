oauthorize
==========

Y(et) A(nother) Oauth2 provider. Lightweight but tries to closely follow the spec.

The initial version is built on Play but one of the design goals was to completely
decouple as much Oauth2 flow/grants/functionality as possible in the idea of writing
an oauthorize-spay (or whatever) version at some point.
